# Hypothesis

<b>Assumption 1:</b>

If a stock has exhibited a steady growth rate over the last several quarters, years, seasons, etc., then we assume that we can forecast its price over future quarters, years, seasons given the histrocal growth rate exhibited over previous periods.

<b>Assumption 2:</b>

An option contract’s strike and premium together at a specific expiration are an indicator of the market’s expectation of the stock’s price at that time.

<b>Hypothesis:</b>

Given assumptions 1 and 2, if the forecasted price exceeds the markets expected price, a mispricing exists.
